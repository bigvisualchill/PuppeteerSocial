- **Instagram SSO Correction**: Reverted to prioritize "Continue with Instagram" button after observing that username login redirected back to home page, implementing proper Instagram OAuth flow
- **Multi-Method Button Clicking**: Implemented comprehensive button clicking strategy with text-based, selector-based, and coordinate-based methods to handle cases where programmatic clicks fail on interactive elements
- **Threads Search URL Fix**: Corrected search function to use proper Threads search URL format (threads.com/search?q=term&serp_type=default) instead of incorrect path-based format, enabling proper post discovery

## Recent Fixes (Latest)

### Threads Content Extraction and Interaction Fix
**Date**: Current Session  
**Issue**: Two critical problems with Threads platform integration:
1. Post content extraction was failing, causing AI to comment on "image" instead of actual post text
2. Like and comment buttons weren't being clicked, so no actual interactions occurred

**Solution**: 
1. **Enhanced getPostContent for Threads**: Implemented comprehensive content extraction with multiple selector strategies and intelligent text filtering to identify actual post content vs UI elements
2. **Improved threadsLike function**: Added robust multi-selector approach with fallback text-based clicking for like buttons
3. **Enhanced threadsComment function**: Implemented comprehensive reply workflow with multiple selector strategies for reply buttons, textareas, and submit buttons

**Technical Details**:
- Added extensive logging for debugging content extraction and button interactions
- Implemented intelligent text filtering to exclude UI elements (Like, Reply, Share buttons, timestamps, etc.)
- Added multiple fallback strategies for element selection (data-testid, aria-label, role-based, text-based)
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages for troubleshooting

**Current State**: Threads platform should now properly extract post content for AI commenting and successfully perform like/comment interactions.

### Threads Comment Submission Fix
**Date**: Current Session  
**Issue**: Comment text was being typed successfully, but the comment was not being submitted because the submit button detection wasn't working.

**Solution**: Updated `threadsComment` function to use keyboard shortcut as primary method:
1. **Primary Method**: Use `Cmd+Enter` keyboard shortcut (more reliable than button detection)
2. **Fallback 1**: Try multiple submit button selectors 
3. **Fallback 2**: Text-based button clicking

**Technical Details**:
- Implemented `page.keyboard.down('Meta')` + `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` for Mac Cmd+Enter
- Added comprehensive error handling with multiple fallback strategies
- Enhanced logging to show which submission method succeeded

**Current State**: Threads comments should now be successfully submitted using the keyboard shortcut method.

### Threads Like Integration and Performance Optimization
**Date**: Current Session  
**Issues**: 
1. Like button wasn't being clicked during auto-comment flow (missing integration)
2. Long artificial delays between actions were slowing down automation

**Solutions**: 
1. **Added Missing Like Integration**: Updated Threads `auto-comment` action to include `likePost` functionality (matching Instagram behavior)
2. **Reduced Artificial Delays**: Optimized delays throughout Threads functions to 1-2 second maximum:
   - Page load delays: 2000ms → 1000ms
   - Post-action delays: 1000-2000ms → 500-1000ms  
   - Between-comment delays: 3000ms → 2000ms
   - Login flow delays: 2000ms → 1000ms
   - Between-like delays: 5000ms → 2000ms

**Technical Details**:
- Added `if (likePost)` block in Threads auto-comment flow to call `threadsLike` after successful comments
- Reduced `sleep()` calls in `threadsLike` and `threadsComment` functions
- Maintained essential delays for UI responsiveness while removing excessive waits
- Added error handling to prevent like failures from stopping comment workflow

**Current State**: Threads platform now supports full like+comment workflow with optimized performance (3-4x faster execution).

### Threads Content Extraction Accuracy Fix
**Date**: Current Session  
**Issue**: The app was extracting account names and UI elements instead of actual post text content, causing AI to generate comments about usernames rather than post content.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the Threads content extraction logic with intelligent filtering:
1. **Specific Selector Priority**: Try data-testid selectors first for reliable extraction
2. **Intelligent Content Detection**: Added scoring system to identify actual post content vs UI elements
3. **Enhanced Filtering**: Skip usernames (@username), timestamps (2h, 5m), UI buttons, and navigation elements
4. **Content Characteristics**: Prioritize text with hashtags, mentions, punctuation, and multiple words
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console output to debug extraction process

**Technical Details**:
- Added strict filtering to exclude elements with `role="button"`, standalone usernames, timestamps
- Implemented content scoring based on hashtags (+3), mentions (+2), punctuation (+2), word count (+1), length (+1)
- Enhanced fallback logic with candidate ranking and detailed logging
- Minimum content length of 15 characters to avoid UI snippets

**Current State**: Threads content extraction now accurately identifies and extracts actual post text for AI commenting.

### Threads Duplicate Detection System
**Date**: Current Session  
**Issue**: App was posting multiple comments on the same Threads posts and re-liking already liked posts, causing spam and potential account restrictions.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive duplicate detection system for Threads similar to Instagram:
1. **Created `threadsHasMyComment.js`**: Dedicated utility for Threads duplicate detection
2. **Comment Cache System**: Persistent cache file (`threads-commented-posts.json`) to track commented posts
3. **Live Comment Detection**: DOM analysis to detect existing comments by logged-in user on current post
4. **Like Detection**: Check for already-liked status before attempting to like posts
5. **Integrated into Auto-Comment Flow**: Added pre-checks before commenting and liking

**Technical Details**:
- **Cache Management**: Persistent storage with `loadCache()`, `saveCache()`, and cache stats functions
- **Post ID Extraction**: Parse Threads URLs to extract unique post identifiers for caching
- **Handle Detection**: Auto-detect logged-in username from navigation elements and profile pictures
- **DOM Analysis**: Search for existing comments using multiple selector strategies and username matching
- **Comment Expansion**: Automatically expand replies/comments to find existing interactions
- **Like Status Check**: Detect filled heart icons and "Unlike" button states

**Current State**: Threads platform now prevents duplicate comments and likes, matching Instagram's behavior for reliable automation.
